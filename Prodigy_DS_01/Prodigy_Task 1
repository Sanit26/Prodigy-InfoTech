üåç 1. Exploring Global Population Dynamics üåç

Description:
This project focused on examining global population trends and their distribution across countries. I sourced data from international databases, conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualized changes in population over time. The study also explored how demographic patterns relate to regional economic and social development.

Key Highlights:

Gathered data from trusted sources like the UN and World Bank.
Cleaned and organized large datasets, addressing missing and inconsistent values.
Created insightful visualizations such as line graphs and geographic heatmaps.
Identified regional factors driving rapid population changes and their broader impact.

Skills Gained:

Improved data cleaning and preprocessing abilities for real-world datasets.
Strengthened skills in data visualization using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Developed a better understanding of population shifts and their effects on global development.
