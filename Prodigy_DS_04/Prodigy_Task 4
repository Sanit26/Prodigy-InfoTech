Description:
This project focused on analyzing sentiment from Twitter data to understand public opinion on various topics. I used Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess and analyze tweets, and built a sentiment classification model to categorize tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.

Key Highlights:

Collected data from Twitter using the Tweepy library and preprocessed it for analysis.
Applied NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
Built a sentiment analysis model using machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

Skills Acquired:

Gained expertise in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text data analysis.
Improved understanding of sentiment analysis techniques and their applications.
Developed skills in handling social media data and extracting actionable insights.
