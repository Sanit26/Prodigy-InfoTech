ðŸ’¼ 3. Smart Banking Decisions ðŸ’¼

Description:
In this project, I worked on predicting the success of marketing campaigns for a bank based on customer information. Using a Decision Tree classifier, I developed a model to predict whether a customer would subscribe to a term deposit based on features such as age, job, and campaign contact details.

Key Highlights:

Preprocessed and cleaned customer data to ensure accurate model inputs.
Built and trained a Decision Tree model using Scikit-learn.
Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Skills Acquired:

Gained hands-on experience in building machine learning models for classification tasks.
Enhanced my understanding of Decision Trees and how they work for marketing predictions.
Improved model evaluation skills and learned how to handle imbalanced datasets.
